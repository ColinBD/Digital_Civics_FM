All the files contained in this folder will be loaded onto the Pi housed within our radio. 

The job this Pi does is to:
	1. Look for user interactions with the interface controls
		a) Switching between streams (twitter, special interest, facebook, instagram)
		b) Pressing play, stop or eject
	2. Run the appropriate python script depending upon what interface interaction occurs

# Digital Civics FM

This repository contains the codebase for Colin, Stuart and Helen's project for their Technologies for Digital Civics module.

# Overview

A focus group of older people expressed a desire for Newcastle University's digital communications to be made accessible to people with low levels of I.T. literacy. We developed Digital Civics FM as a response. This centres on a modified traditional radio which reads out the University's digital communications to the user. Additionally, digital communications relating to a research area of personal interest to the user are included.

## Features

The radio has a dial to allow the user to select one of four streams:
1. Newcastle University's twitter communications
2. Twitter activity relating to the user's research area of interest.
3. Newcastle University's Facebook activity
4. Newcastle University's Instagram activity

The radio has three buttons - play, stop, and eject.
a) The play button reads out tweets if one of the two twitter streams is selectd
b) The stop button ends audio playback
c) The eject button toggles a screen in and out of the radio. The screen is used to display the instagram channel's information
